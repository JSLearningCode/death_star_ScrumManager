Death star project manager (SCRUM PROJECT MANAGER)

This project is a beginner project to learn about frontend, backend and database technologies

At first, I'm using react as frontend framework technology, node js for backend and mongodb as the database

The project is constantly changing, as I learn about the technologies and apply my knowledge, at the very beginning
I'm just making a simple template of how the web page is going to work, for deploying the functionalities in the future.

Below I'll maintain a TODO list, for the Sprints within the project, and the problems (issues) I'm working on.

# TODO

## FRONTEND

### create sprintlist page and necessary components

### create issues page and necessary components

### create issuedescription page and necessary components

## BACKEND
